Support
-------

DFTB+ comes on an as-is basis without official support. However, we have an
`active user community
<https://mailman.zfn.uni-bremen.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dftb-plus-user>`_,
so that problems can be discussed and are usually resolved in very short time.

If you plan to **integrate DFTB+** into your software package, please contact us
directly, so that we can eventually provide specific support to your efforts.
