DFTB+ versions available for download:

* :ref:`DFTB+ Stable <sec_download_stable>` (latest stable version, release
  21.1)
* :ref:`DFTB+ Development version <sec_download_development>` (for experienced
  users only!)

Note: The DFTB+ code needs parameterisation data (Slater-Koster files) in order
to perform calculations. These parameters are not distributed with the code. You
can download the Slater-Koster files from `DFTB.ORG <https://dftb.org>`_.
