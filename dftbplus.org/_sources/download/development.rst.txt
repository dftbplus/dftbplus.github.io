Development version
===================

Contains the `latest DFTB+ features, improvements and fixes
<https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_, which have
been added since the :ref:`last stable release <sec_download_stable>`.

**Source code can be obtained from the** `public git-repository
<https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus>`_. Follow the instructions in the
`INSTALL.rst <https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus/blob/master/INSTALL.rst>`_
file.

If you experience any **issues** with the development version, please **report**
them in the `issue-tracker <https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus/issues>`_, so
that we can fix them before the next stable release.

**Note:** Thanks to our workflow, the development version should be always fully
functional and of release quality. Nevertheless, some of the features may not be
as well tested as for the regular stable releases. Also input keywords of the
new features may change without further notice.
