DFTB+ is an implementation of the Density Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB)
method, containing many extensions to the original method. The development is
supported by various groups, resulting in a code which is probably the most
versatile DFTB-implementation, with some unique features not available in other
implementations so far.


Features
========

DFTB+ offers an approximate density functional theory based quantum simulation
tool with functionalities similar to ab initio quantum mechanical packages while
being one or two orders of magnitude faster. You can optimize the structure of
molecules and solids, you can extract one electron spectra, band structures and
various other useful quantities. Additionally, you can calculate electron
transport under non-equilibrium conditions.

Development
===========

DFTB+ is free software developed by several contributors around the world. In
case you are interested in the actual development or you would like to
:ref:`contribute <sec_contribute>`, check out our `public repository
<http://github.com/dftbplus>`_.
