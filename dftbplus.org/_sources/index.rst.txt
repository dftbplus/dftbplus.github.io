DFTB+ is a **fast and efficient** versatile quantum
mechanical simulation software package. Using DFTB+ you can carry out quantum
mechanical simulations similar to density functional theory but in an
approximate way, typically gaining around two orders of magnitude in speed. (See
:ref:`About DFTB+ <sec_about>` for further details.)

You can use DFTB+ either as a **standalone application** or embed it into your
own academic or commercial simulation package as a **library**.

DFTB+ is **free software** licensed under the *GNU Lesser General Public
License*.

We are proud to announce the next stable release: :ref:`DFTB+ 21.1
<sec_download_stable>`. This release contains several new features. These
include

* Conductor like screening model (COSMO) implicit solvation model for SCC
  calculations, printout of cavity information as a cosmo file

* Extended syntax for selecting atoms in HSD input

* Static coupled perturbed response for homogeneous electric fields (evaluating
  molecular electric polarisability)

* Self consistent DFT-D4 dispersion within the SCC procedure

* Self-consistent DFT-D4 with REKS

* Analytic forces for TS-dispersion (via libMBD 0.12.1)
